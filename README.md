# Color Picker

### Coding challenge

`While the specs to this project weren't exactly met, I am pleased with what I accomplished today.`

To Use:

1. download files
2. open html
3. type a subset
4. see many pretty colors
5. click on colors
6. enjoy
7. repeat

Specs:

- Using RGB Values to prototype
- A user inputs the name of a color.
- The name matches the label of a subset of colors on a color wheel.The colors in the subset are returned.
- Display each color in a rectangle. Vary the lengths of the rectangles using an algorithmof your choice.
- Colors closest to the circumference appear first. Consequently, display the color closestto circumference first and the color closest to the center last.
- On the color wheel, there are two subsets of colors adjacent to the inputted name.Display the labels of the adjacent subsets of colors between the text input box and thedisplayed results. If a user clicks on a displayed label, it sets the value of the text inputbox. The full program executes.
- On the color wheel, opposite the subset labeled the inputted name, there is a subset ofcolors; display the label of this subset. If a user clicks on the displayed label, it sets thevalue of the text input box. The full program executes.
- **Add an additional vector of data consisting of text that is associated with each label.Display the name of this vector in between the text input box and the displayed results.When clicked, cease displaying the colors. Instead, display each set of text in its ownbox.****
- **Allow a user to add an attribute of a result to the user’s “personal” data site. Theattribute can have associated with it a positive or negative value. Thereafter, filter resultsthat have a negative value if the users opts to filter negative values. Also, allow the userto sort by personal preferences with positive as one sort order and negative as anothersort order. Provide the user with controls to adjust these settings.**
